## How to get the ISO and flash it to a USB ?


```bash
download the iso zip and the z01 file make sure they are on a same directory then extract the zip file 

flashing the iso
Windows=use Rufus,Ventoy or BalenaEtcher to flash the iso
Linux=use Ventoy or BalenaEtcher
macOS=use BalenaEtcher

BalenaEtcher and Rufus are typical flashers
 while Ventoy is a muliboot or simply iso booter and its easy to use  
 Rufus is only for windows but its a very good tool and works  
 BalenaEtcher supports all these third operating systems

  
```
